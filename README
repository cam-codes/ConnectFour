Connect Four is a two-player game in which the players take turns dropping a
colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended
grid.

The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within
the column.

The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical,
or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

Connect Four is a solved game.

The first player can always win by playing the right moves.
