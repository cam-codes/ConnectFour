Connect Four is a two-player command-line game in which the players take
 turns dropping a colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row
 vertically suspended grid.

The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within
 the column.

The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical,
 or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
